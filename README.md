# gRPC Client Node

## Overview

This project is a gRPC client implemented in Node.js. It is designed to communicate with a gRPC server, making API calls between microservices using Protocol Buffers.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for client-side development.
- **gRPC**: Remote Procedure Call framework.
- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**: Interface definition language for describing the structure of the data.

## Dependencies

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **gRPC**: `npm install grpc`

## Features

- Basic implementation of a gRPC client in Node.js.
- Utilizes Protocol Buffers for defining service methods and message types.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vishnu-mouli-102408/Client-gRPC-Node.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the gRPC client:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Make API calls:**
    - The client is configured to communicate with a gRPC server. Customize the client code to make specific API calls.

5. **Explore the gRPC Client!**

## Protobuf Definition

The API functionality is defined using Protocol Buffers. Ensure that the `.proto` files used in the client match the ones used by the gRPC server.

## Configuration

Ensure to set the appropriate configuration in your code for connecting to the gRPC server.
